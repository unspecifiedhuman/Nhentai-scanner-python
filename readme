Info~

gen.py will find random codes amd save them to a file.

nhentai-gen-tag.py will get x number of codes with y tag and save them to a file.

both can be used to get bulk files. For gen.py a sacrificial vpn may be needed as you can be blocked by the website. the other script will not block you unless you try to get a LOT of pages.

Thanks for using this.

Update~
Can now search for characters as well inonw w/ longer name.
